Please have "train" and "test" folders as well as "stopwords.txt" in the same folder as the code files.

For naive bayes run the txt_classification.py in an ide, console, etc.
Input the information required as prompted. If you run into an error it's likely that the path maybe wrong.

Example Input:

	Enter the path for the training data: assignment3_train/train

	Enter the path for the testing data: assignment3_test/test


Example Output:

	Implementation of Naive Bayes for text classification-
	Ham Accuracy: 97.70114942528735
	Spam Accuracy: 84.61538461538461
	Total Accuracy: 94.14225941422593
	Implementation of Naive Bayes for text classification without stopwords-
	Ham Accuracy: 98.5632183908046
	Spam Accuracy: 83.07692307692308
	Total Accuracy: 94.35146443514645



For logistic regression run the logisitc_regression.py file in an ide, console, etc.
Input the information required as prompted. If you run into an error it's likely that the path maybe wrong.

Example Input:

	Enter the path for the training data: assignment3_train/train
	Enter the path for the testing data: assignment3_test/test
	Should stopwords be removed: yes
	Enter a lambda value: 0.001
	Enter the number the desired iteration: 25


Example Output:
	
	Training...
	Algorithm is trained, test data will now be classififed.
	Ham Accuracy: 88.79310344827587
	Spam Accuracy: 93.84615384615384
	Accuracy: 90.1673640167364
	
Please wait after you see Training... and Algorithm is trained, test data will now be classified, the code takes time to finish.
